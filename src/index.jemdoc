I am a senior research scientist at Google research in New York. \n

Earlier I was a research assistant professor at [http://www.ttic.edu TTI Chicago ]. I obtained my PhD in ECE at The University of Texas at Austin where I was advised by [http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~sanghavi/  Prof. Sujay Sanghavi]. Before coming to UT, I've spent four wonderful years pursuing my undergraduate studies at Indian Institute of Technology Bombay.
